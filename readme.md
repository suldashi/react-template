Note: Due to the changes in Gulp, this project does not work properly. I am no longer maintaing it, as I have moved to webpack. It is kept here for anyone that wants to try and fix it, or can find some use from it.

This repo is a template for react projects that uses Gulp for bundling and building the JSX files. It includes a basic express and socket.io setup which can be used as a base to build upon real-time apps.
